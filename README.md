# Hierarchical Change-Point Detection

This repository contains the implementation of our Hierarchical Change-Point Detection (HierCPD) model that is fully written in Python. This model addresses the problem of change-point detection on sequences of **high-dimensional** and **heterogeneous** observations (i.e. different statistical data types) with an unknown temporal structure.

There is a notebook demo of the detector performance.

**Graphical model:** Representation of the hierarchical change-point detector. The detection is performed exclusively on the blue region. Additionally, the green region corresponds to the embedded circadian model (see below).
